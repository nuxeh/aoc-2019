It deals significant damage to your hull and causes your ship to begin tumbling violently.\n\nYou can send a droid out to investigate, but the tumbling is causing enough [artificial gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gravity) that one wrong step could send the droid through a hole in the hull and flying out into space.\n\nThe clear choice for this mission is a droid that can *jump* over the holes in the hull \\- a *springdroid*.\n\nYou can use an [Intcode](9) program (your puzzle input) running on an [ASCII\\-capable](17) computer to [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_read-only_memory) the springdroid. However, springdroids don't run Intcode; instead, they run a simplified assembly language called *springscript*.\n\nWhile a springdroid is certainly capable of navigating the artificial gravity and giant holes, it has one downside: it can only remember at most *15* springscript instructions.\n\nThe springdroid will move forward automatically, constantly thinking about *whether to jump*. The springscript program defines the logic for this decision.\n\nSpringscript programs only use [Boolean values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type), not numbers or strings. Two registers are available: `T`, the *temporary value* register, and `J`, the *jump* register. If the jump register is *true* at the end of the springscript program, the springdroid will try to jump. Both of these registers start with the value *false*.\n\nSpringdroids have a sensor that can detect *whether there is ground* at various distances in the direction it is facing; these values are provided in *read\\-only registers*. Your springdroid can detect ground at four distances: one tile away (`A`), two tiles away (`B`), three tiles away (`C`), and four tiles away (`D`). If there is ground at the given distance, the register will be *true*; if there is a hole, the register will be *false*.\n\nThere are only *three instructions* available in springscript:\n\n* `AND X Y` sets `Y` to *true* if both `X` and `Y` are *true*; otherwise, it sets `Y` to *false*.\n* `OR X Y` sets `Y` to *true* if at least one of `X` or `Y` is *true*; otherwise, it sets `Y` to *false*.\n* `NOT X Y` sets `Y` to *true* if `X` is *false*; otherwise, it sets `Y` to *false*.\n\nIn all three instructions, the second argument (`Y`) needs to be a *writable register* (either `T` or `J`). The first argument (`X`) can be *any register* (including `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`).\n\nFor example, the one\\-instruction program `NOT A J` means \"if the tile immediately in front of me is not ground, jump\".\n\nOr, here is a program that jumps if a three\\-tile\\-wide hole (with ground on the other side of the hole) is detected:\n\n```\nNOT A J\nNOT B T\nAND T J\nNOT C T\nAND T J\nAND D J\n\n```\n\nThe Intcode program expects ASCII inputs and outputs. It will begin by displaying a prompt; then, input the desired instructions one per line. End each line with a newline (ASCII code `10`). *When you have finished entering your program*, provide the command `WALK` followed by a newline to instruct the springdroid to begin surveying the hull.\n\nIf the springdroid *falls into space*, an ASCII rendering of the last moments of its life will be produced. In these, `@` is the springdroid, `#` is hull, and `.` is empty space. For example, suppose you program the springdroid like this:\n\n```\nNOT D J\nWALK\n\n```\n\nThis one\\-instruction program sets `J` to *true* if and only if there is no ground four tiles away. In other words, it attempts to jump into any hole it finds:\n\n```\n.................\n.................\n*@*................\n#####.###########\n\n.................\n.................\n.*@*...............\n#####.###########\n\n.................\n..*@*..............\n.................\n#####.###########\n\n...*@*.............\n.................\n.................\n#####.###########\n\n.................\n....*@*............\n.................\n#####.###########\n\n.................\n.................\n.....*@*...........\n#####.###########\n\n.................\n.................\n.................\n#####*@*###########\n\n```\n\nHowever, if the springdroid successfully makes it across, it will use an output instruction to indicate the *amount of damage to the hull* as a single giant integer outside the normal ASCII range.\n\nProgram the springdroid with logic that allows it to survey the hull without falling into space. *What amount of hull damage does it report?*\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](21/input).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Springdroid+Adventure%22+%2D+Day+21+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F21&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle."
