The Elves had written the password on a sticky note, but someone threw it out.\n\nHowever, they do remember a few key facts about the password:\n\n* It is a six\\-digit number.\n* The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.\n* Two adjacent digits are the same (like `22` in `1*22*345`).\n* Going from left to right, the digits *never decrease*; they only ever increase or stay the same (like `111123` or `135679`).\n\nOther than the range rule, the following are true:\n\n* `111111` meets these criteria (double `11`, never decreases).\n* `2234*50*` does not meet these criteria (decreasing pair of digits `50`).\n* `123789` does not meet these criteria (no double).\n\n*How many different passwords* within the range given in your puzzle input meet these criteria?\n\nYour puzzle answer was `2779`.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\-\\-\\- Part Two \\-\\-\\-\n----------\n\nAn Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching digits *are not part of a larger group of matching digits*.\n\nGiven this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:\n\n* `112233` meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.\n* `123*444*` no longer meets the criteria (the repeated `44` is part of a larger group of `444`).\n* `111122` meets the criteria (even though `1` is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double `22`).\n\n*How many different passwords* within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?\n\nYour puzzle input is still `108457-562041`.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27ve+completed+Part+One+of+%22Secure+Container%22+%2D+Day+4+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F4&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle."},"solution":{},"cache_path":null,"cookie_path":null}
