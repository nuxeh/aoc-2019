At least you're drifting in the right direction. You decide to practice a new [card shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling) you've been working on.\n\nDigging through the ship's storage, you find a deck of *space cards*! Just like any deck of space cards, there are 10007 cards in the deck numbered `0` through `10006`. The deck must be new \\- they're still in *factory order*, with `0` on the top, then `1`, then `2`, and so on, all the way through to `10006` on the bottom.\n\nYou've been practicing three different *techniques* that you use while shuffling. Suppose you have a deck of only 10 cards (numbered `0` through `9`):\n\n*To `deal into new stack`*, create a new stack of cards by dealing the top card of the deck onto the top of the new stack repeatedly until you run out of cards:\n\n```\nTop          Bottom\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n                      New stack\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n                  0   New stack\n\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n                1 0   New stack\n\n      3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n              2 1 0   New stack\n\nSeveral steps later...\n\n                  9   Your deck\n  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   New stack\n\n                      Your deck\n9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   New stack\n\n```\n\nFinally, pick up the new stack you've just created and use it as the deck for the next technique.\n\n*To `cut N` cards*, take the top `N` cards off the top of the deck and move them as a single unit to the bottom of the deck, retaining their order. For example, to `cut 3`:\n\n```\nTop          Bottom\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n\n      3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 1 2                 Cut cards\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9         Your deck\n              0 1 2   Cut cards\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2   Your deck\n\n```\n\nYou've also been getting pretty good at a version of this technique where `N` is negative! In that case, cut (the absolute value of) `N` cards from the bottom of the deck onto the top. For example, to `cut -4`:\n\n```\nTop          Bottom\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5           Your deck\n            6 7 8 9   Cut cards\n\n        0 1 2 3 4 5   Your deck\n6 7 8 9               Cut cards\n\n6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5   Your deck\n\n```\n\n*To `deal with increment N`*, start by clearing enough space on your table to lay out all of the cards individually in a long line. Deal the top card into the leftmost position. Then, move `N` positions to the right and deal the next card there. If you would move into a position past the end of the space on your table, wrap around and keep counting from the leftmost card again. Continue this process until you run out of cards.\n\nFor example, to `deal with increment 3`:\n\n```\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n. . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n^                     Current position\n\nDeal the top card to the current position:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n^                     Current position\n\nMove the current position right 3:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n      ^               Current position\n\nDeal the top card:\n\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . . . . .   Space on table\n      ^               Current position\n\nMove right 3 and deal:\n\n      3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . 2 . . .   Space on table\n            ^         Current position\n\nMove right 3 and deal:\n\n        4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . 2 . . 3   Space on table\n                  ^   Current position\n\nMove right 3, wrapping around, and deal:\n\n          5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . 4 1 . . 2 . . 3   Space on table\n    ^                 Current position\n\nAnd so on:\n\n0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3   Space on table\n\n```\n\nPositions on the table which already contain cards are still counted; they're not skipped. Of course, this technique is carefully designed so it will never put two cards in the same position or leave a position empty.\n\nFinally, collect the cards on the table so that the leftmost card ends up at the top of your deck, the card to its right ends up just below the top card, and so on, until the rightmost card ends up at the bottom of the deck.\n\nThe complete shuffle process (your puzzle input) consists of applying many of these techniques. Here are some examples that combine techniques; they all start with a *factory order* deck of 10 cards:\n\n```\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal into new stack\ndeal into new stack\nResult: 0 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7\n\n```\n\n```\ncut 6\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal into new stack\nResult: 3 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6\n\n```\n\n```\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal with increment 9\ncut -2\nResult: 6 3 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9\n\n```\n\n```\ndeal into new stack\ncut -2\ndeal with increment 7\ncut 8\ncut -4\ndeal with increment 7\ncut 3\ndeal with increment 9\ndeal with increment 3\ncut -1\nResult: 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 0 3 6\n\n```\n\nPositions within the deck count from `0` at the top, then `1` for the card immediately below the top card, and so on to the bottom. (That is, cards start in the position matching their number.)\n\nAfter shuffling your *factory order* deck of 10007 cards, *what is the position of card `2019`?*\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](22/input).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Slam+Shuffle%22+%2D+Day+22+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F22&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle.",
