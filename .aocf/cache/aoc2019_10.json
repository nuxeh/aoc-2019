The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe.\n\nThe Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).\n\nThe map indicates whether each position is empty (`.`) or contains an asteroid (`#`). The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position. The asteroids can be described with `X,Y` coordinates where `X` is the distance from the left edge and `Y` is the distance from the top edge (so the top\\-left corner is `0,0` and the position immediately to its right is `1,0`).\n\nYour job is to figure out which asteroid would be the best place to build a *new monitoring station*. A monitoring station can *detect* any asteroid to which it has *direct line of sight* \\- that is, there cannot be another asteroid *exactly* between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or diagonally. The *best* location is the asteroid that can *detect* the largest number of other asteroids.\n\nFor example, consider the following map:\n\n```\n.#..#\n.....\n#####\n....#\n...*#*#\n\n```\n\nThe best location for a new monitoring station on this map is the highlighted asteroid at `3,4` because it can detect `8` asteroids, more than any other location. (The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at `1,0`; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at `2,2`.) All other asteroids are worse locations; they can detect `7` or fewer other asteroids. Here is the number of other asteroids a monitoring station on each asteroid could detect:\n\n```\n.7..7\n.....\n67775\n....7\n...87\n\n```\n\nHere is an asteroid (`#`) and some examples of the ways its line of sight might be blocked. If there were another asteroid at the location of a capital letter, the locations marked with the corresponding lowercase letter would be blocked and could not be detected:\n\n```\n#.........\n...A......\n...B..a...\n.EDCG....a\n..F.c.b...\n.....c....\n..efd.c.gb\n.......c..\n....f...c.\n...e..d..c\n\n```\n\nHere are some larger examples:\n\n* Best is `5,8` with `33` other asteroids detected:\n\n  ```\n  ......#.#.\n  #..#.#....\n  ..#######.\n  .#.#.###..\n  .#..#.....\n  ..#....#.#\n  #..#....#.\n  .##.#..###\n  ##...*#*..#.\n  .#....####\n\n  ```\n\n* Best is `1,2` with `35` other asteroids detected:\n\n  ```\n  #.#...#.#.\n  .###....#.\n  .*#*....#...\n  ##.#.#.#.#\n  ....#.#.#.\n  .##..###.#\n  ..#...##..\n  ..##....##\n  ......#...\n  .####.###.\n\n  ```\n\n* Best is `6,3` with `41` other asteroids detected:\n\n  ```\n  .#..#..###\n  ####.###.#\n  ....###.#.\n  ..###.*#*#.#\n  ##.##.#.#.\n  ....###..#\n  ..#.#..#.#\n  #..#.#.###\n  .##...##.#\n  .....#.#..\n\n  ```\n\n* Best is `11,13` with `210` other asteroids detected:\n\n  ```\n  .#..##.###...#######\n  ##.############..##.\n  .#.######.########.#\n  .###.#######.####.#.\n  #####.##.#.##.###.##\n  ..#####..#.#########\n  ####################\n  #.####....###.#.#.##\n  ##.#################\n  #####.##.###..####..\n  ..######..##.#######\n  ####.##.####...##..#\n  .#####..#.######.###\n  ##...#.####*#*#####...\n  #.##########.#######\n  .####.#.###.###.#.##\n  ....##.##.###..#####\n  .#.#.###########.###\n  #.#.#.#####.####.###\n  ###.##.####.##.#..##\n\n  ```\n\nFind the best location for a new monitoring station. *How many other asteroids can be detected from that location?*\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](10/input).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Monitoring+Station%22+%2D+Day+10+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F10&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle."},"solution":{},"cache_path":null}
