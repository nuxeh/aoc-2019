The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position. The asteroids can be described with `X,Y` coordinates where `X` is the distance from the left edge and `Y` is the distance from the top edge (so the top\\-left corner is `0,0` and the position immediately to its right is `1,0`).\n\nYour job is to figure out which asteroid would be the best place to build a *new monitoring station*. A monitoring station can *detect* any asteroid to which it has *direct line of sight* \\- that is, there cannot be another asteroid *exactly* between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or diagonally. The *best* location is the asteroid that can *detect* the largest number of other asteroids.\n\nFor example, consider the following map:\n\n```\n.#..#\n.....\n#####\n....#\n...*#*#\n\n```\n\nThe best location for a new monitoring station on this map is the highlighted asteroid at `3,4` because it can detect `8` asteroids, more than any other location. (The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at `1,0`; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at `2,2`.)

It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\-\\-\\- Part Two \\-\\-\\-\n----------\n\nOnce you give them the coordinates, the Elves quickly deploy an Instant Monitoring Station to the location and discover the worst: there are simply too many asteroids.\n\nThe only solution is *complete vaporization by giant laser*.\n\nFortunately, in addition to an asteroid scanner, the new monitoring station also comes equipped with a giant rotating laser perfect for vaporizing asteroids. The laser starts by pointing *up* and always rotates *clockwise*, vaporizing any asteroid it hits.\n\nIf multiple asteroids are *exactly* in line with the station, the laser only has enough power to vaporize *one* of them before continuing its rotation. In other words, the same asteroids that can be *detected* can be vaporized, but if vaporizing one asteroid makes another one detectable, the newly\\-detected asteroid won't be vaporized until the laser has returned to the same position by rotating a full 360 degrees.\n\nFor example, consider the following map, where the asteroid with the new monitoring station (and laser) is marked `X`:\n\n```\n.#....#####...#..\n##...##.#####..##\n##...#...#.#####.\n..#.....X...###..\n..#.#.....#....##\n\n```\n\nThe first nine asteroids to get vaporized, in order, would be:\n\n```\n.#....###*2**4*...#..\n##...##.*1**3*#*6**7*..*9*#\n##...#...*5*.*8*####.\n..#.....X...###..\n..#.#.....#....##\n\n```\n\nNote that some asteroids (the ones behind the asteroids marked `1`, `5`, and `7`) won't have a chance to be vaporized until the next full rotation. The laser continues rotating; the next nine to be vaporized are:\n\n```\n.#....###.....#..\n##...##...#.....#\n##...#......*1**2**3**4*.\n..#.....X...*5*##..\n..#.*9*.....*8*....*7**6*\n\n```\n\nThe next nine to be vaporized are then:\n\n```\n.*8*....###.....#..\n*5**6*...*9*#...#.....#\n*3**4*...*7*...........\n..*2*.....X....##..\n..*1*..............\n\n```\n\nFinally, the laser completes its first full rotation (`1` through `3`), a second rotation (`4` through `8`), and vaporizes the last asteroid (`9`) partway through its third rotation:\n\n```\n......*2**3**4*.....*6*..\n......*1*...*5*.....*7*\n.................\n........X....*8**9*..\n.................\n\n```\n\nIn the large example above (the one with the best monitoring station location at `11,13`):\n\n* The 1st asteroid to be vaporized is at `11,12`.\n* The 2nd asteroid to be vaporized is at `12,1`.\n* The 3rd asteroid to be vaporized is at `12,2`.\n* The 10th asteroid to be vaporized is at `12,8`.\n* The 20th asteroid to be vaporized is at `16,0`.\n* The 50th asteroid to be vaporized is at `16,9`.\n* The 100th asteroid to be vaporized is at `10,16`.\n* The 199th asteroid to be vaporized is at `9,6`.\n* *The 200th asteroid to be vaporized is at `8,2`.*\n* The 201st asteroid to be vaporized is at `10,9`.\n* The 299th and final asteroid to be vaporized is at `11,1`.\n\nThe Elves are placing bets on which will be the *200th* asteroid to be vaporized. Win the bet by determining which asteroid that will be; *what do you get if you multiply its X coordinate by `100` and then add its Y coordinate?* (For example, `8,2` becomes *`802`*.)\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](10/input).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27ve+completed+Part+One+of+%22Monitoring+Station%22+%2D+Day+10+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F10&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle."},"solution":{},"cache_path":null}
