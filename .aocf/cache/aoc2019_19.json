It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\-\\-\\- Part Two \\-\\-\\-\n----------\n\nYou aren't sure how large Santa's ship is. You aren't even sure if you'll need to use this thing on Santa's ship, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared. You figure Santa's ship might fit in a *100x100* square.\n\nThe beam gets wider as it travels away from the emitter; you'll need to be a minimum distance away to fit a square of that size into the beam fully. (Don't rotate the square; it should be aligned to the same axes as the drone grid.)\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following tractor beam readings:\n\n```\n#.......................................\n.#......................................\n..##....................................\n...###..................................\n....###.................................\n.....####...............................\n......#####.............................\n......######............................\n.......#######..........................\n........########........................\n.........#########......................\n..........#########.....................\n...........##########...................\n...........############.................\n............############................\n.............#############..............\n..............##############............\n...............###############..........\n................###############.........\n................#################.......\n.................########*O*OOOOOOOOO.....\n..................#######OOOOOOOOOO#....\n...................######OOOOOOOOOO###..\n....................#####OOOOOOOOOO#####\n.....................####OOOOOOOOOO#####\n.....................####OOOOOOOOOO#####\n......................###OOOOOOOOOO#####\n.......................##OOOOOOOOOO#####\n........................#OOOOOOOOOO#####\n.........................OOOOOOOOOO#####\n..........................##############\n..........................##############\n...........................#############\n............................############\n.............................###########\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the *10x10* square closest to the emitter that fits entirely within the tractor beam has been marked `O`. Within it, the point closest to the emitter (the only highlighted `*O*`) is at X=`25`, Y=`20`.\n\nFind the *100x100* square closest to the emitter that fits entirely within the tractor beam; within that square, find the point closest to the emitter. *What value do you get if you take that point's X coordinate, multiply it by `10000`, then add the point's Y coordinate?* (In the example above, this would be `250020`.)\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](19/input).\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can also [Shareon [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27ve+completed+Part+One+of+%22Tractor+Beam%22+%2D+Day+19+%2D+Advent+of+Code+2019&url=https%3A%2F%2Fadventofcode%2Ecom%2F2019%2Fday%2F19&related=ericwastl&hashtags=AdventOfCode) [Mastodon](javascript:void(0);)] this puzzle."
